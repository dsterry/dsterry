# Daniel Terry, PhD
I am a molecular biologist, microscope engineer, and software engineer, currently working as the Acting Director of the <a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/structural-biology/single-molecule-imaging-center.html">Single-molecule Imaging Center</a> at St Jude Children's Research Hospital.

## SPARTAN: Single-molecule Platform for Automated, Real-Time ANalysis
I developed SPARTAN, a set of tools implemented in MATLAB and C/C++ for the analysis of single-molecule FRET data acquired using wide-field TIRF microscopy. SPARTAN is <a href="https://www.scottcblanchardlab.com/software">open source</a>. Initially released in 2013 with our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3769">Nature Methods paper</a>, SPARTAN is designed to efficiently process the large datasets produced using arrays of sCMOS cameras. SPARTAN has been downloaded more than 300 times and is in regular use by laboratories around the world.
